1) Go to scripts/sounds folder in this addon.
2) Copy the two files
3) Go to the garrysmod/garrysmod/scripts/sounds folder
4) Paste them in there
5) Start Gmod. The sounds should work


This is a temporary fix for the lack of scripted sounds until Garry decides to fix what he broke. 
This is valid as of July 13 2011.
This is 5 steps so get it right.

This must be done every time new sounds are added to GDCW, for both the server and the client. Not my fault!
