	"info"		"GDC SWEPs and NPC modifiers. This pack includes 15 assault weapons (6 are useable by NPC's), an NPC spawning tool for use with the weapons, and a ragdoll and gun removal tool to prevent lag buildup and allow endless NPC battles! Devenger and Major Victory created the npc cleanup and npc spawner tools, so don't say I stole credit! I also take no credit for the weapon models."
